"""Render every ``html`` template in the web UI, and report what mis-parses.

The templates are tagged-template literals driven through the vendored
preact-htm bundle -- the same code the browser runs -- so this check needs
no browser and no build step, only a small JavaScript engine.  It exists
because of a bug class no static check can see.  An attribute expression
that has lost its ``$`` -- ``onWrite={(payload) =>`` -- is read by htm as
a quoted value whose text then swallows the markup up to the next ``}``;
the page does not crash, the tab is just quietly wrong: elements without
tag names, a handler's source rendered as prose.  Something like this
shipped once, and neither Biome nor the wiring checks saw anything.

So that is the check: evaluate each template through the real parser with
every free identifier stubbed, then walk the resulting virtual DOM and
report the one shape no valid output contains -- an element whose type is
``undefined``, its tag name consumed as text (``H001``).  The stubs cannot
hide a mis-parse: parsing happens in the template's statics, before any
value is ever looked up, so anything that renders cleanly under stubs
parses cleanly in the browser.

The parser is also what says where the markup ends, which catches a
second mistake that renders rather than crashing.  A template is markup,
not code, and markup has no comments: a ``/* ... */`` written inside one
is not stripped by anything -- htm keeps it as text and the page shows it
to the user, in the middle of a card (``H004``).  The tag is wrapped on
the way in so each template's statics -- its markup, everything that is
not a ``${...}`` -- can be read as it parses, which is what keeps a real
comment inside an interpolation from being mistaken for one.

The engine is PyMiniRacer: an embedded V8 in one wheel, so no Node, no
npm and nothing to compile.  It is neither a dependency of any program here
nor one of the default dev set -- it is ~80 MB and publishes no armv7
wheel, and these tools have to stay installable on a Raspberry Pi.  It
lives in the ``browser`` dependency group instead::

    uv sync --group browser

and the check skips itself, saying so, when the engine is absent.  Run it
over a program's own UI::

    python -m devicectl.devtools.htmcheck src/<program>/web/static

or let that program's pytest do it; either way a problem is one line of
``path:line: CODE message``.
