"""Fan-out of backend events to every connected browser.

One :class:`Broadcaster` per server.  Anything worth telling the UI about --
the state of the link, a fresh reading, a job's progress -- is published
here, and every open ``/api/events`` stream gets a copy.  Publishers never
block: each subscriber owns a bounded queue, and a subscriber that cannot
keep up loses its oldest events rather than stalling the worker that owns
the device.

Some events describe *state* rather than an occurrence (the link is idle,
the reading is this).  Those are published as ``sticky``: the broadcaster
remembers the latest one per name and replays them to a new subscriber, so a
browser that connects (or reconnects) sees the current world immediately
instead of waiting for something to change.
